# Library Management System

A comprehensive C++ application designed for managing a library's collection of books and members. This system allows librarians to track books, register members, manage borrowing operations, and maintain records efficiently.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, remove, and display all books in the library
- **Member Management**: Register, remove, and list all library members
- **Borrowing System**: Track book loans and returns
- **Member History**: View books currently borrowed by each member
- **Data Persistence**: All data is automatically saved to text files
- **User-friendly Interface**: Console menu system for easy navigation
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single library instance throughout the application

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need:

- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- Catch2 (version 3) for running tests

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Diogo-Rodriigues/LibraryManagementSystem-Cpp.git
   cd library-management
   ```

2. Create a build directory and compile the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./bin/library_manager
   ```

## Usage

### Main Menu
The application provides a simple menu-driven interface:
- **Viewing Menu**: Access information about books and members
- **Management Menu**: Perform operations like adding/removing books and members, borrowing/returning books

### Example Operations

#### Adding a Book
1. Select "Management" from the main menu
2. Choose "Add Book"
3. Enter the book's ID, title, and author when prompted

#### Borrowing a Book
1. Select "Management" from the main menu
2. Choose "Borrow Book"
3. Enter the book ID and member ID when prompted

#### Viewing Member's Borrowed Books
1. Select "Viewing" from the main menu
2. Choose "View Books of a Member"
3. Enter the member ID when prompted
